    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Concept of Business: Goal: Inform. Method: Structured text (headings, lists, paragraphs). Interaction: Read-only. Justification: Basic definitions and characteristics are best presented textually.
        - Sole Proprietorship & Partnership: Goal: Compare & Inform. Method: Structured text, toggleable lists for Advantages/Disadvantages. Interaction: Click to expand/collapse lists. Justification: Manages lengthy lists and allows focused comparison.
        - Types of Industry: Goal: Organize & Inform. Method: Hierarchical list structure (HTML <ul>/<li> or styled divs). Interaction: Read-only. Justification: Clearly presents categorical information.
        - Product Life Cycle: Goal: Illustrate a dynamic concept. Method: Line chart (Chart.js on Canvas) showing stages. Interaction: Hover for tooltips (default Chart.js). Justification: Visually represents the progression and is more engaging than text alone.
        - Other textual concepts (e.g., Trade, Joint Stock Co., Marketing): Goal: Inform. Method: Structured text, toggleable sections for detailed lists. Interaction: Navigation selection, content toggles. Justification: Standardized presentation for textual information, ensuring consistency and usability.
        - Diagrams (e.g., Business Components from PDF p4): Goal: Illustrate structure. Method: Recreated using HTML divs and Tailwind CSS for simple block diagrams. Interaction: Read-only. Justification: Provides a visual representation of relationships as in the source, without using SVG.

                    <p class="mb-3">Forming a Joint Stock Company involves several distinct stages:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-3 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Promotion Stage:</strong> This is the initial phase where the idea for the business is conceived, investigated for feasibility, and necessary factors (like resources, financial sources) are assembled. Essential documents like the Memorandum of Association, Articles of Association, and Prospectus are prepared.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorporation Stage:</strong> This involves filing all required documents with the Registrar of Companies and paying the registration fee. Upon satisfaction, the Registrar issues a Certificate of Incorporation, officially bringing the company into existence.</li>
                        <li><strong>Capital Subscription Stage:</strong> After incorporation, the company raises capital by inviting the public to subscribe to its shares, debentures, or other securities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Certificate of Commencement:</strong> For public companies, this certificate is required before they can start business operations. It is issued after the company has issued a prospectus, allotted shares, and received the minimum subscription amount.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="text-lg font-medium text-orange-500 my-2">Types: Public vs. Private Limited Company</h4>
                    <p class="mb-3">Joint Stock Companies are primarily divided into two types, with key differences:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-3 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Public Limited Company:</strong> Can offer shares to the general public, has a minimum of 7 members (no maximum), and shares are freely transferable. Subject to more stringent regulations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Private Limited Company:</strong> Shares cannot be offered to the public, has 2-50 members, and share transfer is restricted. Generally has fewer regulatory requirements.</li>

                    <p class="mb-3">Franchising is a business arrangement where a "franchisor" (the original business owner) grants rights to a "franchisee" (an independent business person) to sell/offer products or services using the franchisor's established trademark, name, systems, methods, and even packaging materials. In return, the franchisee pays a fee or royalty to the franchisor.</p>

                        <li><strong>For the Franchisee:</strong> Gets access to a big, recognized business with a proven model, reducing the risk of failure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lower Failure Rate:</strong> Franchised businesses typically have a lower failure rate compared to new, independent ventures because they operate under a tested brand and established procedures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Franchisor Guidance/Support:</strong> Franchisees often receive training, marketing support, and ongoing operational guidance from the franchisor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Choice of Location:</strong> Franchisees often have some input or choice in selecting their business location, within the franchisor's guidelines.</li>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-600 mb-2">Joint Venture</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">A Joint Venture (JV) occurs when two or more people or organizations combine their resources (like capital, expertise, or technology) to undertake a specific business project or activity. They share the capital investment, financial burden, risks, and profits. JVs are often formed to exploit new opportunities that would be too large or risky for one entity alone.</p>

                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-3 space-y-1 hidden">
                        <li><strong>Acquire New Expertise:</strong> Gain access to specialized knowledge or skills from the partner.</li>
                        <li><strong>Enter New Geographic Markets:</strong> A local partner can provide insights and access to a foreign market.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gain New Technological Knowledge:</strong> Share R&D and technological advancements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sharing Specialized Staff/Technology:</strong> Efficiently utilize unique resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sharing Risks:</strong> Financial and operational risks are distributed among partners.</li>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6 mb-2">Strategic Alliance</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">A Strategic Alliance is a less formal arrangement than a joint venture, where two or more organizations collaborate for mutual profits without forming a new, separate legal entity. They pool resources (products, distribution networks, manufacturing capabilities, funding, equipment, knowledge, intellectual property) to achieve shared objectives while remaining independent.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">Example: The airline industry often forms strategic alliances (like Star Alliance or SkyTeam) to offer broader route networks and shared loyalty programs without merging their operations.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6 mb-2">Merger</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">A Merger occurs when two or more organizations combine to form a completely new, single organization. The original entities cease to exist independently, and a new combined entity takes their place. This is often done to achieve synergies, increase market share, or reduce competition.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6 mb-2">Acquisition</h3>
                    <p class="mb-3">An Acquisition happens when one business buys out another business. In an acquisition, the acquiring company typically takes over the ownership and control of the target company, which may or may not cease to exist as a separate legal entity, but its ownership shifts significantly towards the acquiring partner.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-orange-600 mt-6 mb-2">Common Advantages of Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)</h3>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-3 space-y-1">
                        <li><strong>Expansion of Size:</strong> Rapidly increases the size and scale of operations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimize Operational Cost:</strong> Can lead to economies of scale and reduced overheads by combining operations.</li>

                    <p class="mb-3">A COLA is a clause often included in labor contracts (agreements between management and labor unions) that ties future wage raises to changes in consumer purchasing power. Essentially, it's an automatic increase in wages or benefits to account for inflation, ensuring that the real value of earnings does not decrease over time.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3"><strong>Context:</strong> COLA is a part of <strong>Compensation</strong> strategies and is typically negotiated during <strong>Collective Bargaining</strong>, which is the process where labor unions and management negotiate terms and conditions of employment, including wages, benefits, and working conditions.</p>
                    <p class="mb-3">The purpose of COLA is to maintain the standard of living for employees by adjusting their income in response to increases in the cost of living, usually measured by consumer price indices.</p>

In the <strong>Maturity</strong> stage, sales peak and then stabilize or start to decline slightly as competition increases. Finally, in the <strong>Decline</strong> stage, sales fall off significantly.</p>
